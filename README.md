## About The Project

A decent looking terminal version of the most-loved BrickBreaker games. It features multiple powerups like - Shrink Paddle, Expand Paddle, Multi-ball, Thru-ball...(I'll keep some for you to discover when you play the game). You have five lives to course through the game and clear all the bricks on which you will win.

There is a tiny binary clock to the side - just to make it harder for you to forget how long you have been playing.. :smile:
